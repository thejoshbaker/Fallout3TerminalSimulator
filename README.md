# Fallout3TerminalSimulator
This a game made using python and the console window. This game is meant to recreate Fallout3's terminal game

### How to Play

1. Copy all files to folder where you want game
2. Run the .exe file
3. Enjoy

### Settings 

The settings file is very flimsy as mentioned in the game, if you want no issues than simply avoid the settings option, however here is how you change the settings 


> [QTN] Close Settings \
> [NOA] Number of Attempts     (Must be Number) \
> [NOL] Number of Letters      (Must be Number from 4-6) \
> [SKI] Skip Intro             (0 = false : 1 = true) \
> Setting > {A} \
> New Value > {B} 

*What you will see in game*

For the {A} slot you want to write the symbol of what you want to change, ex: *Setting > NOA* \
You can then change the value, which the parenthises will explain what to input, ex: *New Value > 10*

That is how you can change the number of attempts to 10 \
When you are done put QTN into the setting option

### Game

When you start the game you type in the answer into the box below, and thats it! The rest is just going off Fallout terminal style
