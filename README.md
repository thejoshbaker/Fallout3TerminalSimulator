# Fallout3TerminalSimulator
This a game made using python and the console window. This game is meant to recreate Fallout3's terminal game

## Overview

### Debates:

**Should the terminal have a dark green bg?**

> Answer: No

> Reason: This is meant to me a modern rendition of the Fallout 3 Terminal, so it should have modern ideas of the same concept. The dark green wouldnt fit well with this idea in mind.

**Should the words to choose from be from a catagory or all random?**

> Answer: Yes

> Reason: We decided to make all words related to Fallout in some way, making the words seem cooler than just random.
